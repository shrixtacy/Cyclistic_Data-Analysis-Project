# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis

## Project Overview
Cyclistic is a bike-share company in Chicago seeking to increase the number of annual memberships. This project analyzes the differences in behavior between casual riders and annual members to provide recommendations for converting casual riders into members.

## Problem Statement
Cyclistic aims to boost annual memberships as these are more profitable than casual rides. To achieve this, we analyze how casual riders differ from annual members in terms of usage patterns, and propose strategies to encourage membership conversions.

## Data Sources
- Publicly available data on Cyclistic bike-share trips.
- Data includes details such as trip duration, start and end times, and user type (casual or member).
- Data is provided by Motivate International Inc. and is used in compliance with privacy regulations.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
1. Removed rows with missing values in key columns.
2. Converted date-time columns and calculated trip durations.
3. Filtered out zero or negative ride lengths.
4. Added new columns for analysis, including `ride_length` and `day_of_week`.

## Analysis and Visualizations
The analysis focused on understanding usage patterns through:
- Comparing ride durations between user types.
- Analyzing usage by day of the week.
- Visualizing ride counts and average ride lengths.

Key insights were derived regarding the different behaviors of casual riders and annual members.

## Recommendations
1. **Weekend Membership Promotions**: Target casual riders with membership promotions during weekends.
2. **Leisure-Focused Campaigns**: Highlight the value of memberships for frequent leisure use.
3. **Leisure-Friendly Membership Tier**: Develop a new membership option tailored to casual, leisure-oriented riders.

## Conclusion
By understanding the distinct needs of casual riders, Cyclistic can create targeted marketing strategies to increase membership sign-ups, boosting the companyâ€™s profitability and growth.
